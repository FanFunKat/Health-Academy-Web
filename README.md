# Akatemia Zdrowia Ukryte Skrzydła Website
A single-page site created for the psychotherapy office Ukryte Skrzydła, aimed at promoting and presenting its offerings. The site introduces the therapist, her achievements, reviews from past clients, her specializations with pricing, and ways to contact the office.  
The initial idea was to maintain the simplicity of the site, avoiding excessive special effects. In the briefing, the client indicated the main color scheme for the site – warm yellow and oranges, and provided illustrative and photographic materials that were used on the site.  
The visual design was created in Figma. To build the structure of the site, I used HTML5, CSS3 for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
